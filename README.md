# Artist and song recommender
## **Due to the recent updates with Spotify API, this project now runs with Jamendo API**
This program interacts with the Spotify API to retrieve and display up to 5 different artists based on the genre inputed. 
It makes discovering new artists simple by parsing raw data received from the API and displaying it in a user friendly format.
The program in V.2 allows you to play a preview of the random songs that generate.
In V.3, the program allows you to like a song and put it into a playlist that you can find in the GUI pop-up
It allows you to see if a song is worth listening to the entire way.
